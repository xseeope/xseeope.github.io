## CONVERTING ANALYSTS' FORECASTS TO A VALUATION

**With book value information from the financial statements in Exhibit 2.2 in Chapter 2, calculate the firm's traded P/B ratio in March 2011.**

KMBâ€™s traded P/B in March 2011 was 4.49 (65.24/14.54), we have calculated it in Chapter 3.

**With analysts' forecast of a five-year growth rate, you can forecast analysts' EPS estimates for the years 2013- 2015. Do this and, from these forecasts, lay out the corresponding return on common equity (ROCE) and residual earnings. You will need the book value per share at the end of 2010; you can calculate this from the balance sheet given in the Kimberly-Clark case in Chapter 2. For the residual earnings calculations, use a required return for equity of 8 percent.**

**Now go ahead and value KMB's shares from this proforma. Assume a long-term growth rate in residual earnings after the five-year forecast period of 4 percent, roughly equal to the average GDP growth rate. What is your intrinsic price-to-book ratio? What is your V/P ratio? What reservations did you develop as you went about this task?**

in 2013-2015, EPS grow at a rate of 9.1%
for years after 2015, EPS grow at a rate of 4%

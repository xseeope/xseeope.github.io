### exercise 3

**Buy or Sell?**

A firm reports book value of shareholders' equity of \$850 million with 25 million shares outstanding. Those shares trade at \$45 each in the stock market. An analyst values the equity by following the scheme: <font color='orange' style='font-weight:bold'>Value = Book value + Extra value</font>. She calculates extra value of \$675 million. Should she issue a buy or a sell recommendation to her clients?

Taxes are negative (that is, the effect on income is positive) because income is negative (a loss).
**A loss yields a tax benefit** that he firm can carry forward to reduce future taxes.

Ending shareholders’ equity can be derived in two ways:

1. Shareholders’ equity = assets – liabilities= 4,340 – 1,380 = 2,960

2. Shareholders’ equity = Beginning equity + comprehensive income – net dividends<br>
= Beginning equity + (net income + other comprehensive income) -(dividends + share repurchases – share issues)<br>
= 19,140 +(2,300-150-90)-(400 +150 –900)<br>
= 19,140 + 2,060 – (-350)<br>
= 21,550

The two numbers do not agree. There is an error somewhere.

<font color='#0086b5'>$\boxed{\large{Formulas :}}$</font>

* Shareholders’ equity = Beginning equity + comprehensive income – net dividends
* comprehensive income = net income + other comprehensive income
* net dividends = dividends + share repurchases – share issues

### exercise 1

A firm trading with a total equity market value of \$100 million reported earnings of \$5 million and book value of \$50 million. This firm is used as a comparable to price an IPO firm with EPS of \$2.50 and BPS(book value per share) of \$30. Neither firm pays dividends. What per-share IPO price does the comparable firm imply?

<details>
<summary style="width: 7.7em">Answers:</summary><br>

P/E for the comparable firm = 100/5 = 20<br>
P/B for the comparable firm = 100/50 = 2<br>
Price for target, from earnings = $2.50 × 20 = $50 per share<br>
Price for target, form book value = $30 × 2 = $60 per share<br>
Average of the two prices = $55 per share<br>

General Mills reported \$6, 192 million in short-term and long-term debt at the end of 2005 but very little in interest-bearing debt assets.<br>
Use a required return of 9 percent to calculate both the enterprise value and equity value for General Mills at the beginning of 2006 under two forecasts for long-run cash flows:

* a. Free cash flow will remain at 2009 levels after 2009.
* b. Free cash flow will grow at 3 percent per year after 2009.

General Mills had 369 million shares outstanding at the end of 2005, trading at \$47 per share. Calculate value per share and a value-to-price ratio under both scenarios.

* Reported cash flows from operations in U.S. cash flow statements includes <u>interest</u> (a financing cash flow):

Cash flow from operations(C) = Reported cash flow from operation s+ After-tax net interest payments<br>
After-tax Net Interest  = Net Interest × (1 - tax rate)<br>
Net interest = Interest payments – Interest receipts

* Reported cash flow from operations is sometimes referred to as levered cash flow from operations.

---

* Reported cash investments include net investments in interest bearing financial assets (excess cash) (which is a financing flow):

Cash investment in operations (I) = Reported cash flow from investing − Net investment in interest-bearing securities<br>
Net investment = purchases of investments – sales of investments

Suppose these numbers were given to you at the end of 1999, as forecasts, when the book value per share was \$9.96, as indicated. Use a required return of 11 percent for calculations below.

* a. Calculate residual earnings and return of common equity (ROCE) for each year, 2000-2004.
* b. Value the firm at the end of 1999 under the assumption that the ROCE in 2004 will continue at the same level subsequently. Would you call this a Case 1, Case 2, or Case 3 valuation?
* c. Based on your analysis, give a target price at the end of 2004.

### exercise 2

**Valuation of Microsoft Corporation**

In 2010, some fundamental investors believed that Microsoft, after being overpriced in the stock market for many years, was now a firm to buy. Microsoft's shares traded at \$24.30 in September 2010, down from a peak of $60 (split-adjusted) in January 2000.

Analysts' consensus EPS forecasts for 2011 and 2012 fiscal years (ending in June) were \$2.60 and \$2.77, respectively. A dividend of \$0.40 per share was indicated for fiscal year 2011.

* a. Calculate Microsoft's normal forward P/E and the forward P/E at which it traded in September 2010. Use a required return of 9 percent.

* b. Calculate the intrinsic P/E implied by the analysts' forecasts with the assumption that there will be no abnormal earnings growth after 2012.

* c. If you forecast that there will be significant abnormal earnings growth after 2012, do you think this stock is appropriately priced at $24.30?

a.

Normal forward P/E = 1/0.09 = 11.11

Traded forward P/E = $\dfrac{\$24.30}{\$2.60}$ = 9.346

b.

Valuation with no growth:

$𝑉_{2010} = \dfrac{1}{0.09}\lbrack2.60+\dfrac{−0.028}{1.09}\rbrack = \$28.60$

Intrinsic P/E = $\dfrac{\$28.60}{\$2.60}$ =11.00

c. The value without growth is higher than the market price. So, if you saw some abnormal earnings growth ahead, the stock is definitely underpriced.

### exercise 2

**Using Accounting Relations that Govern the Equity Statement.**

The following is a statement of common shareholders' equity with some numbers missing (in millions of dollars).

<table>
  <tr>
    <td id="td2l">Balance, December 31, 2011</td>

* a.The market value of the equity was \$4,500 million at December 31, 2011, and \$5,580 million at December 31, 2012. At both dates, the equity traded at a premium of \$2, 100 million over the book of the common equity. What was net income for 2012?

* b. Fill out the missing numbers in the equity statement and reformulate it to identify comprehensive income for the common shareholders for 2012.

<details>
<summary style="width: 7.7em">Answers:</summary><br>

a.

* Balance, December 31, 2011 = $4,500 - 2,100 = $2,400 million
* Balance, December 31, 2012 = $5,580 – 2,100 = $3,480 million

These numbers supply the missing balances in the statement. Given these balances, the only missing item is net income. This must be $1,083 million.

b. The reformulated statement is as follows:

> [!TIP|label:Items included in Operating Liabilities]
> <mark>Accrued expenses</mark>, also known as accrued liabilities, are expenses recognized when they are incurred but not yet paid in the accrual method of accounting. Typical accrued expenses include utility, salaries, and goods and services consumed but not yet billed. <br><mark>Deferred tax liability</mark> is the amount of taxes a company has "underpaid" which will be made up in the future. This doesn't mean that the company hasn't fulfilled its tax obligations. Rather it recognizes a payment that is not yet due.  
For example, a company that earned net income for the year knows it will have to pay corporate income taxes. Because the tax liability applies to the current year, it must reflect an expense for the same period. But the tax will not actually be paid until the next calendar year. In order to rectify the accrual/cash timing difference, tax is recorded as a deferred tax liability.

First reformulate the balance sheet:

||	2012|	2011|
|:----------------|:------|:------|
|NOA$\qquad$|	3160|	2900|
|NFO|	1290|	1470|
|CSE|	1870|	1430|

其中：

* 3160=60+940+910+2840-1200-390
* 1290=1840-550

Method 1:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  Free \ cash \ flow &= OI - \Delta NOA\\
  &= 500 – (3,160 – 2,900)\\
  &= 240
\end{aligned}
$$
	
Method 2:

$$
\begin{array}{lll}
  Free \ cash \ flow &=&\ NFE – ΔNFO + d \\
  Net \ dividend &=&\ CI(Comprehensive \ income)– \Delta CSE (stocks\ and\ flows\ equation)\\
  &=&\  376 – (1,870 – 1,430) \\
  &=&\  -64\\
  So,&&\ \\
  Free\ cash\ flow &=&\  124 – (-180) + (-64)\\
                &=&\  240
\end{array}

### exercise 2

**Applying Cash Flow Relations.** 

A firm reported free cash flow of \$430 million and operating income of \$390 million.<br>
a. By how much did its net operating assets change during the period?<br>
b. The firm incurred net financial expenses of \$43 million after tax, paid a dividend of \$20 million, and raised \$33 million from share issues. What was the change in its net debt position during the period?

<details>
<summary style="width: 7.7em">Answers:</summary><br>

a.

|$\Delta NOA$|	=|	OI - (C - I)|
|:------|:------|:------|
||	=|	390 - 430|
||	=|	- \$40 million|

(The firm reduced its investment in net operating assets.)

b.

|C - I|	=|	$NFE - \Delta NFO + d$ |
|:------|:------|:------|

So, with a negative net dividend of $13 million

|$\Delta NFO$|	=|	NFE + d - (C - I)|
|:------|:------|:------|
||=|43 – 13（33-20） - 430|
||=|- \$400 million|

(The firm reduced its NFO by \$400 million by applying free cash flow and the net dividend to reducing net debt).

**Relationship Between Rates of Return and Leverage.**

* a. A firm has a return on common equity of 13.4 percent, a net after-tax borrowing cost of 4.5 percent, and a return of 11.2 percent on net operating assets of \$405 million. What is the firm's financial leverage?
* b. The same firm has a short-term borrowing rate of 4.0 percent after tax and a return on operating assets of 8.5 percent. What is the firm's operating liability leverage?
* c. The firm reported total assets of \$715 million. Construct a balance sheet for this firm that distinguishes operating and financial assets and liabilities.

**Profit Margins, Asset Turnovers, and Return on Net Operating Assets: A What-If Question.**

A firm earns a profit margin of 3.8 percent on sales of \$435 million and employs net operating assets of \$150 million to do so. It considers adding another product line that will earn a 4.8 percent profit margin with an asset turnover of 2.3.

What would be the effect on the firm's return on net operating assets of adding the new product line?

<details>
<summary style="width: 7.7em">Answers:</summary><br>

The effect would be (almost) zero.

$\qquad$ Existing RNOA  =  PM $ \times $ ATO = 3.8% $ \times $ 2.9 =  11.02%

RNOA from new product line is:

$\qquad$ RNOA =  4.8% $ \times $ 2.3  = 11.04%

<font color='#0086b5'>$\boxed{\large{Formulas :}}$</font>

$RNOA = \frac{OI}{NOA} = \frac{OI}{Sales}\times \frac{Sales}{NOA} = PM \times ATO(asset\ turnover)$

**Analyzing a Change in Core Operating Profitability.**

The following numbers were calculated from the financial statements for a firm for 2012 and 2011:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th id="th1"></th>
    <th id="th1">2012</th>

Calculate core return of net operating assets (core RNOA) and show how much of its change from 2011 to 2012 is due to the change in profit margin and the change in asset turnover. Box 13.7 will help you.

<details>
<summary style="width: 7.7em">Answers:</summary><br>

Core RNOA for 2012 = 4.7% x 2.4 = 11.28%

Core RNOA for 2011 = 5.1% x 2.5 = 12.75%

Change in Core RNOA		-1.47%

\begin{aligned}
\Delta core RNOA&= \Delta CorePM_1 \times ATO_{\color{red}{0}} +\Delta ATO_1 \times CorePM_1\\

### Additional Exercise

1. **If assets are measured at their fair (intrinsic) value, the analyst must forecast that residual earnings from those assets will be zero. Is this correct?**

This is correct. The assets are expected to earn at their required return.  Therefore expected residual income is zero.

2. **What drives growth in residual operating income?**

Residual operating income growth is driven by an increase in RNOA and in the NOA that earn at this RNOA. Breaking it down further, ReOI growth is driven by<br>
* Growth in sales (that drives growth in NOA) 
* Increase in operating profit margins
* Increase in asset turnovers (so NOA increases but sales increase more that NOA)

3. **A Wall Street analyst predicted in 2010 that, after the considerable deleveraging during the financial crisis, firms would begin once again to lever up with more borrowing. "They must defend their return on equity," he claimed. As a result, "investors should look for a rise in dividends and share buy-backs and an expansion of PIE multiples, leading to equity market outperformance." Is he correct?**

He is correct in saying that increased leverage will typically result in higher ROCE. But an increase in leverage does not increase equity value. And an increase in leverage will reduce P/E ratios (see the leverage example in Box 14.5 and formula 14.12.). It may be that there will be more share buy-backs and dividends of firms use the borrowed funds for such purpose, but that will not add to shareholder value. 

## Chapter 15

### exercise 1

**A No-growth Forecast and a Simple Valuation.**

An analyst calculates residual operating income of \$35.7 million from financial statements for 2012, using a required return for operations of 10%. She also forecasts residual operating income at the same level for 2013 and years after on net operating assets of \$1,257 million at the end of 2012.

* a. What is the analyst's forecast of operating income for 2013?
* b. What is the value of the operations based on these forecasts?
* c. What is the forward enterprise P/E ratio implied by the forecasts?

<details>
<summary style="width: 7.7em">Answers:</summary><br>

a.

$ReOI_{2013} = OI_{2013} – (0.10 ×1,257) = \$35.7 million$ (= that in 2012)

$Therefore,\ OI_{2013} = \$161.4 million$

b.

With $ReOI_{2013}$ forecasted to be a constant, a no-growth valuation applies:

$V_{2012}^{NOA} = 1257 + \frac{35.7}{0.10} = \$1614 million$

c.

Forward (enterprise) P/E = $\dfrac{V_{2012}^{NOA}}{OI_{2013}} = \$1614/\$161.4 = 10.0$

Constant ReOI (and a no-growth valuation) implies a normal P/E ratio for a 10% required return
</details>

### exercise 2

**Simple Valuation with Sales Growth Rates**<br>
An analyst forecasts that the current core return on net operating assets of 15.5 percent will continue indefinitely in the future with a 5 percent annual sales growth rate. She also forecasts that the current asset turnover ratio of 2.2 will persist. Calculate the enterprise price-to-book ratio if the required return for operations is 9.5 percent.

<details>
<summary style="width: 7.7em">Answers:</summary><br>

If RNOA is constant and ATO is also constant, the growth rate for ReOI is given by the sales growth rate. So, 

$$
V_0^{NOA}=NOA_0 \times\bigg[\frac{RNOA-(g-1)}{\rho_F-g}\bigg]
$$

Hence, the enterprise P/B ratio $=\dfrac{0.155-(1.05-1)}{1.095-1.05} = 2.33$
</details>

### Additional exercise

1. **When is the forecasted growth rate in residual operating income the same as the forecasted growth rate in sales?**

The growth rate for sales is the same as the growth rate in residual operating income when RNOA is constant, the required return is constant, and asset turnovers are constant.  (If RNOA is constant and ATO is constant, profit margins (PM) must also be constant.)

2. **Would you call a firm that is expected to have a high sales growth rate a growth firm?**

A firm with high expected growth in sales is probably a firm that can grow residual earnings.  But sales have to be profitable: a firm might grow sales, but with declining profit margins and increasing asset turnovers, that is, with rising expenses per dollar of sales and increasing investment to get a dollar of sales. A growth firm is one that can grow residual operating income. Sales growth does not necessarily imply residual income growth.

3. **Simple Forecasting and Valuation (Medium)**<br>
   An analyst uses the following summary balance sheet to value a firm at the end of 2012(in millions of dollars):

||2012|2011|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Net operating assets|4,572|3,941|
|Net financial obligations|1,243|1,014|
|Common shareholders' equity|3,329|2,927|

The analyst forecasts that the firm will earn a return on net operating assets (RNOA) of
12 percent in 2013 and a residual operating income of \$91.4 million.<br>
* a. What is the required rate of return for operations that the analyst is using in his resid-ual operating income forecast?
* b. The analyst forecasts that the residual operating income in 2013 will continue as a perpetuity. What value does this imply for the equity?
* c. Calculate the forecast of residual earnings (on common equity) for 2013 that is implied by these forecasts. The firm's after-tax cost of debt is 6.0 percent.

## Chapter 16

### exercise 1

**One-Stop Residual Operating Income Calculation: Coca-Cola Company.**

The Coca-Cola Company reported an after-tax profit margin of 20% on its sales of \$24,088 million in 2006. It also reported \$102 million of other core income, mainly from equity investments in its bottling companies. Further analysis of the financial statements reveals an asset turnover (on net operating assets) of 1.32. Coke uses a hurdle of 9% for its investment in operations.

* a. What was Coke's residual operating income for 2006?
* b. What would Coke's residual operating income be if the asset turnover increased to 1. 7?

<details>
<summary style="width: 7.7em">Answers:</summary>

An alternative solution:

Core OI = (\$24,088 × 0.20) + 102 = \$4,919.6

NOA= $\frac{Sales}{ATO}$=\$24,088/1.32 = 18,248.5

ReOI = \$4,919.6 – (0.09 × 18,248.5) = 3,277.3 million

b.

$$
\begin{aligned}
  ReOI &= 24088 \times \big(0.20-\frac{0.09}{1.70}\big) +102\\
  \\
  &= \$3644.4 million

**Using the cash flow statement for 2010 in Exhibit 2.2 in Chapter 2 and any other information you glean from the 10-K, lay out the sequence that concludes with the treasurer's trading in debt, as in Box 8.1.**

<table><tr><td bgcolor=lightgrey>

$
\begin{array}{lr}
 \text{Cash flow from operations} & 2,888\\
 \text{Cash investment in operations} & 946\\
 \text{Free cash flow} & 1,942\\
 \text{Cash interest received (after tax)} &(144) \\
 \text{Cash available for shareholders} & 1,798\\
 \text{} & \\
 \text{Net dividend (net cash paid to shareholders):} & \\
 \text{Cash dividend} & 1,066 \qquad \qquad\\
 \text{Share repurchases} & 803 \qquad \qquad\\
 \text{Share issues} & (131) \qquad \qquad\\
 \text{Other} & 48 \qquad 1786\\
 \text{Net transactions in debt} & 12\\
\end{array}
$
</td></tr></table>

**Now take this information and present it in the form of a summary cash flow statement (as in Box 8.2) that obeys the equation: Free cash flow = Distributions to shareholders + Distributions to net debtholders. One question you will have to resolve is the treatment of the increase in cash and cash equivalents of $\text{\textdollar}$78 million over the year.**

\begin{array}{lr}
 \text{Cash flow from operations (C)} & 2,888\\
 \text{Cash investment (I)} & (946)\\
 \text{Free cash flow (C - I)} & 1,942\\
 \text{} & \\
 \mathbf{Equity financing flows (d):} & \\
 \text{Dividends and share repurchases} & 1,875\\
 \text{Share issues} & 0\\
 \text{} & 1,875\\

 \mathbf{Debt financing flows (F):} & \\
 \text{Net purchase of financial assets} & (77)\\
 \text{Interest on financial assets (after tax)} & (24)\\
 \text{Net issue of debt} & (37)\\
 \text{Interest paid on debt (after tax)} & 157\\
 \text{} & 67\\

 \mathbf{Total financing flows (d + F):} & 1,942\\

# Presidential Address: Discount Rates
Journal of Finance 2011

> ## Abstract

> Discount-rate variation is the central organizing question of current asset-pricing research. I survey facts, theories, and applications. Previously, we thought returns were unpredictable, with variation in price-dividend variation corresponds to discount-rate variation. We also thought that the cross-section of expected returns came from the CAPM. Now we have a zoo of new factors. I categorize discount-rate theories based on central ingredients and data sources. Incorporating discount-rate variation affects finance applications, including portfolio theory, accounting, cost of capital, capital structure, compensation, and macroeconomics.

资产的价格应当等于现金流期望的折现。在 1970 年，Eugene Fama（1970）通过测试市场有效性为我们提供了一个进行资产定价研究的框架，该框架基于“期望”角度，而在本文中，作者 Cochrane 则提出我们更应该从“折现”的角度展开研究。

## Time-Series Facts

## The Cross-Section

早期的实践者认为只需要考虑收益最大化，而 CAPM 指出所有具有高平均回报的策略也都有较高的 market beta。然而异相的出现又为解释横截面收益带来了混沌。
